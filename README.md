In some cases, you may find that you need to bulk-delete many posts from your Bluesky account. For example, perhaps you shared many links to a particular domain and now you want to remove them en masse. Doing this manually would be tedious. Fortunately, we can automate the process using a script written in TypeScript.
blog post about it https://blog.rmendes.net/2024/12/15/how-to-bulk.html

This script leverages the official `@atproto/api` package to:
1. Log into your Bluesky account.
2. Fetch all posts that match certain criteria (e.g., containing a specific domain in their facets, embeds, or entities).
3. Delete them in batches while respecting and reacting to rate limits.


## Key Features


- **Domain-based Filtering:**  
  The script identifies posts containing a specific domain by checking:
  - Facets with `app.bsky.richtext.facet#link`.
  - External embeds with `app.bsky.embed.external`.
  - Legacy entities with `type: link`.
  
- **Rate Limit Management (Proactive):**  
  The Bluesky PDS imposes a rate limit of 5000 deletion points per hour. Deletions cost 1 point each. The script proactively monitors how many deletions it has performed within the current hour. When it approaches the limit, it waits until the hour has elapsed before continuing.


- **Rate Limit Management (Fallback):**  
  If the script ever hits a `429 Rate Limit Exceeded` error, it will parse the `ratelimit-reset` header and wait until the given time before retrying that batch of deletions. This ensures that if the proactive limit check is not enough, the script still handles the serverâ€™s instructions gracefully.


- **Batch Operations and Delays:**  
  To avoid rapid-fire requests, the script:
  - Performs deletions in configurable batch sizes (default: 200 per batch).
  - Waits a short delay between batches to spread requests out over time.


## Prerequisites


- **Node.js and npm:**  
  Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.


- **Install Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install @atproto/api p-ratelimit
  ```
- **Use a CommonJS Approach:**
If you simply want to run ts-node in a CommonJS environment (the traditional way):

Install ts-node and typescript locally (if not already):
  ```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
  ```
Set "module": "commonjs" (and "target": "ES2020" or later) in your tsconfig.json. For example:
  ```bash
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2020",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      }
    }
  ```
## Credentials


Replace your-handle and your-password in the script with your Bluesky account credentials. You should only do this with an account you control and trust running scripts on.


## Running the Script


Save the script below as bluesky-sweep.ts.


Run it using:


```bash
npx ts-node bluesky-sweep.ts
```
## Configuration Parameters
- TARGET_DOMAIN: Set this to the domain you want to search for in your posts.
- DELETES_PER_BATCH: Number of posts per deletion batch.
- MAX_DELETES_PER_HOUR: Maximum deletions allowed per hour (5000 is the current default from Bluesky).
- SAFE_MARGIN: A buffer to start waiting before hitting the exact limit.
- DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES_MS: Milliseconds to wait between each batch.
